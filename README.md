a. What is an issue? Issues are items that are created in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.

b. What is a pull request? Pull requests are a means of conveying the changes you have made to a branch in a repository on Github 

c. How do I open up a pull request? Firstly we need to fork the repository to our own username account. From there we click ‘Compare and pull request’ to create pull request for the associated branch. Then we click the 'compare across forks' icon so that our base dropdown  has the upstream repository we want to merge changes into and the base says main. We then add a title and description for our pull requests before finally selecting “create pull request”. 

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository. Firstly please know the username of the person you are inviting as a colloborator to a personal repository. Then on the Github webpage go to the main page of the repository. Open the settings tab in the desired respository, go to Access section and click on Collaborators. From there Add people and type their username to add them to the repository. The user will receieve a notification for an invitation which they have to accept to be able to edit the repository.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes to our code whereas GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories

f. What does git diff do? Git diff is a multi-use git command that takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them.

g. What is the main branch? It is the default branch in a repository and is the original thread of code for a project’s codebase. When someone visits a repository and forks or clones the main branch, is gets checked out and served down to the user’s computer.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch? We should make a branch of the main and commit changes to it as we go. This will allow us to easily review changes and track issues in our codebase as compared to working directly in the main branch.
